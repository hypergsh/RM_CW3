The research implemented a hybrid architecture combining the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic, with particular attention to the complexity and diversity of questions in educational environments. The authors evaluated the system through user studies, having teachers and students test and provide feedback on answer quality and educational value. Results demonstrated that this hybrid approach outperforms pure LLM methods in handling fuzzy queries in educational content, better understanding the temporal continuity and conceptual associations in student questions, providing strong support for educational applications.
